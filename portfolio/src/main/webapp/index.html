      <p>I love home food. I love food. That is all </p>
      <p>I generally love taking pictures of places I visit or pictures of my friends (because I know their angles).
           New York is my favorite place to take pictures of but it's so busy so I find it hard to enjoy myself there.
            San Francisco might be the best place overall for me. </p>
